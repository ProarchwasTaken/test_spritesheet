# test_spritesheet
I learned how to use sprite sheets and play animations properly

This program tests handling spritesheets, and playing proper animation. I just felt like learning how to do this kind of
thing is very important to making any kind of game with graphics beyond simple, single colored shapes. I learned a bit
about how surfaces work and how many more uses they have. I think they can act as layers and you can chose area of an
image you want to draw when using "surface.blit", you can use this feature to get a specific image from a spritesheet.
I wonder what else I could do with Surfaces?

You are free to use this program as a reference for future projects.

I had to follow a tutorial to figure out how to use spritesheets but I figured out the animation system on my own! The
previous animation prototype I wrote was kinda messy, and inefficient. Is there anything I could've done better?
